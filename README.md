# Neural-Machine-Translation-by-jointly-learning-to-align-and-translate

Orchestrated the curation of a proprietary dataset of source and target languages by leveraging cutting-edge language converters.
Additionally, employed Google Translator to derive equivalent English text, while also manually translating simpler Telugu sentences to ensure
data authenticity.
Deployed deep learning and NLP fundamentals to drive the project, adopting sequence-to-sequence modeling and encoder-decoder
architectures. Relied on Python for robust implementation, and ingeniously crafted a custom dataset class to facilitate efficient tokenization,
culminating in its seamless integration into the PyTorch framework.
Triumphed over challenges like neural network training intricacies, optimal model architecture selection, and effectively processing long
sentences. This perseverance was instrumental in maintaining data quality and navigating linguistic hurdles inherent to machine translation
tasks.
Demonstrated leadership prowess by captaining a dedicated team of 3, steering them through phases of meticulous planning, rigorous research,
and precise project execution.
